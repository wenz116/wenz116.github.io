I am a second-year M.S. student in the Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering at National Taiwan University.
I am also a Research Assistant in the [Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.citi.sinica.edu.tw) at Academia Sinica under the supervision of [Dr. Yen-Yu Lin](https://www.citi.sinica.edu.tw/pages/yylin/), [Dr. Yi-Hsuan Tsai](https://sites.google.com/site/yihsuantsai) (NEC Laboratories America) and [Prof. Ming-Hsuan Yang](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/) (UC Merced).
Before that, I received my B.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University in 2017.

My research interests are **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**. Here is my [CV](https://wenz116.github.io/files/ywchen_cv.pdf).
