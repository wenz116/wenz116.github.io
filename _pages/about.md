I am a Researcher at [NEC Laboratories America](https://www.nec-labs.com/research/media-analytics/). Before that, I received my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from University of California, Merced in 2024, under the supervision of Prof. [Ming-Hsuan Yang](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/) in the [Vision and Learning Lab](http://vllab.ucmerced.edu/). I completed my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University.

My research interests lie in **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**, with a primary focus on vision-language learning, video understanding and generative models. Here is my [CV](https://wenz116.github.io/files/Yi-Wen_Chen_cv.pdf).
