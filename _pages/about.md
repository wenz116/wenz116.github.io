I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at University of California, Merced, under the supervision of Prof. [Ming-Hsuan Yang](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/).
Before that, I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University in 2017 and 2019, respectively.

My research interests are **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**. Here is my [CV](https://wenz116.github.io/files/Yi-Wen_Chen_cv.pdf).
